|| I've got it to write proper    ||
|| public key values to the data- ||
|| -base. The next thing to do is ||
|| rearrange all the function and ||
|| classes as some functions are  ||
|| more suited for other spots in ||
|| the code. (this is due to my   ||
|| lack of pre-planning)          ||
||                                ||
|| A lot of stuff could go in     ||
|| Program.User for ease of use,  ||
|| and I could put WeaveString()  ||
|| in Encryption.cs, as that      ||
|| would ascoiate it with other   ||
|| security functions/classes     ||
